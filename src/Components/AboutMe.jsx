                    I'm a Full stack developer with training as a Web Designer. Experience working on projects with NodeJS, React, Redux, SQL, among other technologies in the sector. I was part of a team of programmers with whom we developed a project where I deployed more in the Front-end, but I feel comfortable working on the Back-end too. I have good skill and poise to work in a team, communicate, acquire new knowledge and judge me in a constructive way to work on my errors and faults.
